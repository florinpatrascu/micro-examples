<h1 id="welcome">ÂµScheduler</h1>

<p>This is a small demo micro web application demonstrating the use of the Quartz based scheduler available as a Micro extension</p>

<p>Enter the desired number of seconds that a test controller will wait for before running:</p>

<form action="${request.ContextPath}/index.html" method="POST">
  Seconds before running: <select name="nr-seconds-to-wait">
    #foreach($period in [2, 5, 10, 15, 20])
    <option value="$!{period}">$!{period}</option>
    #end
  </select>
  <br>
  <input type="submit" value="schedule">
</form>

<p>Check your console for the results of running the test action, after submitting the desired option.</p>
